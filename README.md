# STM32F4 ARM Assembly 

This is an example project demonstrating *LED blinking* on the STM32F411CE microcontroller, logic of project programmed entirely in **ARM Assembly**.
The project was created using the `CMSIS framework` within `PlatformIO`.
For **ARM Assembly** syntax highlighting in `VS Code`, the extension **"Arm Assembly"** *by dan-c-underwood* was used.
